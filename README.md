# MicroInternship-NLP
## Assignment 1.ipynb: 
- Performed exploratory text data analysis by examining character lengths, word counts, word lengths, two-gram analysis, and topic modeling
## Assignment 2.ipynb:
- Loaded dataset using Pandas and performed text preprocessing on radiology report data like stop-word removal, data cleansing, and data transformation
- Generated TFIDF vectorization to further visualize the data using the T-SNE method
## Assignment 3.ipynb:
- Continued from Assignment 2 but instead, utilizing vectorized words to conduct report category classification using Logistic regression with Scikit-Learn
## Project.ipynb:
- Vectorized words in two formats: TFIDF and Word2Vec embedding.
- Conduct classification using both vectorization and evaluate its accuracy
